## üéØ Documentation Overview

### API.md - API Documentation
Complete reference for all API endpoints including:
- Authentication endpoints (register, login, logout, token refresh)
- Task management endpoints (upload, retrieve, update)
- Dashboard endpoint
- Request/response formats
- Error handling
- Testing examples with cURL and Postman

### DATABASE.md - Database Schema
Comprehensive database documentation covering:
- Collection schemas (Users, Tasks, DistributedTasks)
- Field descriptions and types
- Relationships and foreign keys
- Indexes for performance
- Query examples
- Security considerations
- Migration strategies

### DEPLOYMENT.md - Deployment Guide
Platform-specific deployment instructions for:
- Heroku
- Railway
- Render
- AWS EC2
- DigitalOcean
- MongoDB Atlas setup
- Environment configuration
- Security hardening
- Monitoring and maintenance

## üîë Key Concepts

### Authentication
AgentX uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with httpOnly cookies for secure authentication. See [API.md](API.md#authentication) for details.

### Task Distribution
Tasks are distributed equally among active agents using a fair round-robin algorithm. See [DATABASE.md](DATABASE.md#data-flow) for the algorithm details.

### Role-Based Access
- **Agents**: Can view and update their assigned tasks
- **Admins**: Can upload tasks and manage agents (authorization to be implemented)

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Tasks

### Setting Up Development Environment
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Vashishta-Mithra-Reddy/agentx.git
cd agentx/backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

See [Backend README](../backend/README.md) for more details.

### Uploading Tasks
```bash
# Upload CSV file
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/tasks/upload \
  -b cookies.txt \
  -F "file=@tasks.csv"
```

See [API.md](API.md#upload-tasks) and [examples/README.md](../examples/README.md) for more details.

### Deploying to Production
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for platform-specific instructions.

## üìù Documentation Standards

All documentation follows these principles:
- **Clear and concise**: Easy to understand for all skill levels
- **Example-driven**: Includes practical examples and code snippets
- **Up-to-date**: Reflects the current state of the codebase
- **Well-organized**: Logical structure with clear headings and navigation

## üîÑ Keeping Documentation Updated

When making changes to the codebase:
1. Update relevant documentation in the same PR
2. Add examples for new features
3. Update API docs for new/modified endpoints
4. Update database docs for schema changes
5. Update deployment docs for infrastructure changes

## ü§ù Contributing to Documentation
